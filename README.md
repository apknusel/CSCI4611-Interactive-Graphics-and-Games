# CSCI4611-Interactive-Graphics-and-Games
A collection of project I worked on for CSCI4611: Interactive Computer Graphics and Games
## Assignment 1
This assignment involves creating a simple, fun game using 2D graphics. You will learn to:
- Use TypeScript and GopherGfx for some serious programming
- Work with 2D graphics coordinate systems and vectors
- Implement game update loops and event handlers
- Animate computer graphics based on user input

## Assignment 2
This program covers a number of important computer graphics concepts. Specifically, you will learn to:
- Use TypeScript and GopherGfx to build a 3D graphics program
- Draw simple 3D geometric objects
- Work effectively with 3D points, vectors, and geometric transformations
- Balance the tradeoffs between realism and effective gameplay by simulating physics in a plausible but not necessarily realistic way
- Successfully program your first interactive 3D graphics game!

## Assignment 3
In this assignment, you will learn to:
- Visualize real-world geographical data on a 3D textured globe.
- Apply textures to 3D objects.
- Algorithmically create a deforming 3D mesh and display it using vertex buffers.
- Define normal vectors and texture coordinates for a sphere.
- Convert from spherical coordinates (latitude and longitude) to 3D Cartesian coordinates.

## Assignment 4
In completing this assignment, your goal should be to learn:
- How transformations can be composed in a hierarchy to create a scene graph and/or, in this case, an animated character within a scene.
- How transformations can be used to scale, rotate, and translate basic shapes (unit cubes, spheres, cylinders, and cones) into more complex scenes and characters.
- How mocap data can be used and manipulated in multiple ways to create different types of animations. For example:
- How to create a looping animation that smoothly interpolates between the beginning of the motion clip and the end to avoid any discontinuities.
- How to overlay new motion clips onto a character at runtime, for example, making your character jump in a game when you press a button, or in our case, perform one of a series of cool ballet moves.
- How to read and extend some fairly sophisticated computer graphics code.

## Assignment 5
In this assignment, you will learn:
- How to calculate artistic per-pixel lighting in real-time.
- How to modify geometry on the fly to create viewpoint-dependent effects such as silhouette outlines.
- How to manipulate per-pixel normals to create the illusion of more complex surfaces.
- How to implement and use your own shader programs!

## Assignment 6
In this assignment, you will learn:
- How to perform 3D mesh editing operations in response to user input.
- How to use pick rays and intersection tests to convert 2D screen space coordinates (e.g., the mouse position, a 2D curve onto the screen) into a 3D virtual world.
- How to implement a computer graphics algorithm described in a research paper.
